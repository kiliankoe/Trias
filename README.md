# üöè Trias

This aims to be a client library for TRIAS systems enabling you to access public transport data from compatible providers. This library does
not aim to implement TRIAS as closely as possible, but only as far as it makes sense when using it with Swift. Native types and ease of use
are preferred, but customizability and complex requests should still be possible.

Official documentation can be found [here [PDF]](https://www.vdv.de/431-2-sdsv1.2.pdfx?forced=false).

**This library is still very much a work-in-progress and should be considered non-functional for the time being.**

## Installation

Trias is available through Swift Package Manager.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/kiliankoe/Trias.git", from: "<#latest#>")
```

## Terms of Service

Please refer to your provider's terms of service regarding use of their services. Establishing a line of contact is never a bad idea, *especially* if 
excessive use is planned.
